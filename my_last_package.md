        child: DockBounceIcon(
          bounceHeight: 40,
          duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 600),
          soundAsset: 'sounds/heartbeat.mp3',
          bounceCount: 12,
          onBounceStart: () => debugPrint("Bounce started"),
          onBounceEnd: () => debugPrint("Bounce ended"),
          onTap: () => debugPrint("Icon tapped"),
          child: const Icon(
